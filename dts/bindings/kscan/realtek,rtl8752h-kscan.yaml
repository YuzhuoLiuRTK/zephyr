  RTL8752H KSCAN.

  The RTL8752H KSCAN should be used with an external kscan matrix.
  There is a total of 12 rows and 20 columns. You can assign any available pins
  to row or colunm by pinctrl.
  The rows and columns need to be indexed starting from 0.

  Example of devicetree configuration.

  &kscan {
        pinctrl-0 = <&kscan_default>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
        row-size = <2>;
        col-size = <2>;
        debounce-time-ms = <10>;
        scan-time-ms = <10>;
        release-time-ms = <10>;
        scan-debounce-cnt = <1>;
        status = "okay";
    };

    &pinctrl {
        kscan_default: kscan_default {
            group1 {
              psels = <RTL8752H_PSEL(KEY_COL_0, P0_6, DIR_OUT, DRV_LOW, PULL_NONE)>,
              <RTL8752H_PSEL(KEY_COL_1, P0_7, DIR_OUT, DRV_LOW, PULL_NONE)>;
            };
            group2 {
              psels = <RTL8752H_PSEL(KEY_ROW_0, P2_4, DIR_IN, DRV_LOW, PULL_UP)>,
              <RTL8752H_PSEL(KEY_ROW_1, P2_5, DIR_IN, DRV_LOW, PULL_UP)>;
              bias-pull-strong;
            };
        };
    };
